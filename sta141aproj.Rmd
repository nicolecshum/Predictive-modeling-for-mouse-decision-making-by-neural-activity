## Abstract

Decision making based on visual perception in mice is correlated with neural activity from a wide variety of brain areas. In this report, we present an analysis of a data set from Steinmetz et al. (2019.) This data set comprises of the data recorded from hundreds of trials of mouse decision-making, with neural activity in the form of brain spikes recorded by Neuropixels probes. This analysis aims to develop and evaluate a predictive model for success in decision making based on neural activity. Exploratory data analysis is first used to gain insights into the distribution, relationship, and patterns within the dataset, through descriptive statistic visualizations and correlation analyses. In order to build predictive models, XGBoost modeling and generalized linear models are utilized. The performance of each model is evaluated based on accuracy, confusion matrices, precision-recall curves, and AUC. Overall, the most suitable approach to predicting feedback type was using models based on average neuron spikes per session-specific brain area, trained through XGBoost modeling. Additionally, hypotheses are made on the most important factors on the predictive performance of the model, providing insights for future studies or analysis.

## 1. Introduction <a id="intro"></a>

In Steinmetz et al. (2019), Neuropixels probes were used to record neuron spikes in 42 brain regions of mice performing a task requiring visual discrimination. Each mice was presented with stimuli on two screens on either side of it, and were made to decide which side had greater contrast via a wheel controlled by their forepaws, through a reward and penalty system. A success was granted if the mouse turned the wheel towards the stimulus with less contrast (e.g. if left contrast > right contrast, success if the mouse turned the wheel ot the right.) In addition, if both contrasts were zero, success was granted if the mouse held the wheel still. If both contrasts were nonzero and equal, left or right was chosen as the correct answer randomly. Failures were assigned otherwise.

In this analysis, we will use the data from 18 sessions of this study, from four mice. In addition, while the study collected data on a larger time interval, our analysis focuses on only the spikes recorded for 0.4s after the stimulus is presented. This report is broken up into multiple sections which can be navigated to with the navigation bar above.

This report was made with `R markdown`. The `rmd` file to generate this document is available here.

## 2. Exploratory data analysis <a id="eda"></a>

### Data structure across sessions

The data is separated into 18 sessions. For the overall session, the name of the mouse that was tested (one of four: Cori, Forssmann, Hench, and Lederberg), the date of the session, and the brain areas recorded with the Neuropixels are provided.  Each session also contains the data of hundreds of trials, the number of trials differing between each session. The number of neurons recorded differ between each session, ranging from 474 neurons in Session 16 and 1769 neurons in Session 4. 

Each trial records neuron spikes for 0.4 seconds post-stimulus, as well as the left and right contrast of the stimuli and the feedback type (success or failure). The neuron spikes are recorded in a list of matrices, one for each trial, with the columns indicating the time with increments of 0.01 seconds, and the rows indicating each neuron recorded.

### Exploring neural activities during each trial

#### Which brain areas are most relevant to success rate?

There seems to be an overall weak positive correlation between success rate and average spikes in most brain areas. Neurons in the visual cortex, thalamus, hippocampus, and basal ganglia had slightly higher correlations than other brain areas consistently, with average correlations over all sessions of 0.162, 0.171, 0.156, and 0.157 respectively. Below are the correlation matrices for brain areas and feedback type measured in Session 1 and 18.

There seems to be more average spikes per neuron for successful trials in Session 1, and likewise for Session 18. However, the difference in average spikes is not very large (14% increase in success for S1, 9% increase in success for S18). In this data set, brain spikes are recorded for 0.4s after the stimulus; it may be possible that focusing on a smaller time period may be more effective in distinguishing between average number of spikes for success and failure.

The average number of spikes per neuron stays consistently greater in successful trials (See appendix (<a href="#a-1-2">Section I.ii</a>) for the plots.) For 0-0.2s, the percent differences were a 9% increase in success for S1 and a 10% increase in success for S18. For 0.2-0.4s, the percent differences were a 20% increase in success for S1 and a 9% increase in success for S18. For 0.1-0.3s, the percent differences in success were an 18% increase for S1 and an 11% increase for S18. In order to maximize the distinction in average brain spikes between success and failure, we will use the time interval with the highest percent differences, which was 0.1-0.3s.

#### Is there a correlation between average spike rate per time interval and success rate?

There may be an interaction between the average spike rate per neuron and the time at which these spikes happen. In order to test this, we may look at the change in average spike rate per time interval over multiple sessions.

It seems that the average spike rate stays relatively constant throughout each trial. We will investigate further if there is a correlation between spike rate and success rate.

### Exploring changes across trials

#### Is there a correlation between left/right contrast and success rate?

There does not seem to be a correlation between the raw values of left and right contrast and the success rate of trials. See appendix (<a href="#a-1-3">Section I.iii</a>) for more information. However, there may be a correlation between the difference between left and right contrast and the success rate of trials. In other words, it may be easier for the mouse to make a decision when the distinction between the left and right stimulus is more obvious.

```{r}

diffs = c()
feeds = c()
feeds.num = c()
for (i in seq_along(session1$contrast_left)) {
  left = session1$contrast_left[[i]]
  right = session1$contrast_right[[i]]
  abs_diff = abs(left - right)
  feed = session1$feedback_type[[i]]
  if (feed == 1) {
    feed2 = "Success"
  }
  else if (feed == -1) {
    feed2 = "Failure"
  }
  
  diffs = c(diffs, abs_diff)
  feeds = c(feeds, feed2)
  feeds.num = c(feeds.num, feed)
}
diff.feed.df = data.frame(
  lr.diff = diffs,
  feedback = feeds, 
  feedback.num = feeds.num
)
diff.feed.num.df = data.frame(
  lr.diff = diffs,
  feedback = feeds.num
)

diff.corr = diff.feed.num.df %>%
  cor

cor1 = ggcorrplot(diff.corr, type= "lower", hc.order = TRUE, lab = TRUE) +
  labs(title="L/R Difference, S1")

```

```{r}
diffs = c()
feeds = c()
feeds.num = c()
for (i in seq_along(session18$contrast_left)) {
  left = session18$contrast_left[[i]]
  right = session18$contrast_right[[i]]
  abs_diff = abs(left - right)
  feed = session18$feedback_type[[i]]
  if (feed == 1) {
    feed2 = "Success"
  }
  else if (feed == -1) {
    feed2 = "Failure"
  }
  
  diffs = c(diffs, abs_diff)
  feeds = c(feeds, feed2)
  feeds.num = c(feeds.num, feed)
}
diff.feed.df = data.frame(
  lr.diff = diffs,
  feedback = feeds, 
  feedback.num = feeds.num
)
diff.feed.num.df = data.frame(
  lr.diff = diffs,
  feedback = feeds.num
)

diff.corr = diff.feed.num.df %>%
  cor

cor2 = ggcorrplot(diff.corr, type= "lower", hc.order = TRUE, lab = TRUE) + 
  labs(title = "L/R Difference, S18")

corplots = list(cor1, cor2)

grid.arrange(grobs=corplots, ncol=2)
```

There seems to be an overall weak positive correlation between the difference in contrast between L/R and feedback type for all sessions (average correlation = 0.143). See appendix (<a href="#a-1-3">Section I.iii</a>) for more information on the other sessions.

### Homogeneity and heterogeneity across sessions and mice

#### Is there a correlation between the date of the session and the percentage of correct feedback?

There may be a trend in the date of the session and the success rate of the mice. It may be argued that as the mice went through more trials, their ability to correctly distinguish between stimuli got better. Because the data set we are using may be incomplete, we will assume that each mouse accumulates experience at the same rate as the others, with an equal amount of sessions undergone, increasing as the date increases.

```{r}
sessionsvsdate <- data.frame(Session = sessions, Date = dates, Success_Rate = all_sessions_feed_vec)
kable(sessionsvsdate, format="html", table.attr ="class='table table striped'")
```

Each session is labeled according to the date, in sequential order. So, sessions with higher numbers occurred more recently. It also seems that the success rate increased as the date of the session increased. See appendix (<a href="#a-1-4">Section I.iv</a>) for a visual representation of this data.

Below is a correlation matrix relating success rate and failure rate to session number.

```{r}

sessions.num <- as.numeric(sessions)

success.num <- as.numeric(sub("%", "", all_sessions_feed_vec)) / 100

failure.num <- 1 - success.num

sessionsbysuccess <- data.frame(session = sessions.num, success = success.num, failure = failure.num)

corr = sessionsbysuccess %>%
  cor

ggcorrplot(corr, type= "lower", hc.order = TRUE, lab = TRUE)

```

The correlation of 0.76 between session number and success rate suggests a moderately strong positive correlation between session number and success rate, indicating that the mice were able to be more successful in trials as time went on.

#### Are some mice more successful than others?

```{r}

cori <- c()
forssmann <- c()
hench <- c()
lederberg <- c()

names <- c()

for (i in seq_along(all_sessions)) {
  name <- all_sessions[[i]]$mouse_name
  if (name == "Cori") {
    cori <- c(cori, success.num[i])
  }
  else if (name == "Forssmann") {
    forssmann <- c(forssmann, success.num[i])
  }
  else if (name == "Hench") {
    hench <- c(hench, success.num[i])
  }
  else if (name == "Lederberg") {
    lederberg <- c(lederberg, success.num[i])
  }
  names <- c(names, name)
}

cori.m = mean(cori)
fors.m = mean(forssmann)
hench.m = mean(hench)
leder.m = mean(lederberg)

mouse.m = c(cori.m, fors.m, hench.m, leder.m)
mouse = c("Cori", "Forssmann", "Hench", "Lederberg")
trial.lab = c(paste("n =",length(cori)), paste("n =",length(forssmann)), paste("n =",length(hench)), paste("n =",length(lederberg)))
trials = c(length(cori), length(forssmann), length(hench), length(lederberg))
mouse.ms = data.frame(name = mouse, mean = mouse.m, trials = trials)

ggplot(data = mouse.ms, aes(x = name, y = mean, fill = name)) +
  geom_bar(stat = "identity") +
  labs(title=paste("Average Success Rate by Mouse"), 
       x= "Mouse Name", 
       y= "Average Success Rate") +
  geom_text(aes(label = trial.lab), vjust= 3)

```

It seems that Lederberg has the highest average success rate out of the mice and Cori has the lowest average success rate out of the mice. However, it should be noted that the number of trials between each mouse is not equal. The number of trials is indicated by n, labeled on each bar. It seems that the number of trials may also be related to the average success rate of each mouse.

## 3. Data integration <a id="di"></a>

### Shared patterns across sessions

#### Average spike rate per time bin by trial

Each session has a varied amount of trials, but the information from each trial can be compiled into a large data frame made up of trials from all sessions. This creates a larger data set to train the predictive model on.

Each trial across the sessions records brain spikes for 0.4 seconds post-stimulus in 0.01s intervals. It is possible to take data from every trial in every session and look at the average spike rate per time interval, separated by success and failure. Below is a scatter plot indicating the average change in spike rate over the 0.4s time interval.

```{r, message = FALSE}

#### L/R contrast difference by trial

In addition, we can use this same approach to create a data frame of difference between L/R contrast and feedback type from each trial from every session. Here is a histogram depicting this data.

```{r}
lr.diffs = c()
feeds = c()
for (i in 1:18) {
  left = all_sessions[[i]]$contrast_left
  right = all_sessions[[i]]$contrast_right

  for (j in seq_along(left)) {
    #left right difference
    l = left[[j]]
    r = right[[j]]
    diff = abs(l - r)
    lr.diffs = c(lr.diffs, diff)
    
    #feedback type
    feed.trial = feed[[j]]
    feeds = c(feeds, feed.trial)
  }
}

)

  best_coeff = names(coeff)[which(coeff > 0)]
  best_coeffs[[i]] = best_coeff

  all_coeffs[[i]] = coeff
}

#can't standardize across sessions :(
#knn for distance between two trials
#multiple imputation?

```

### Addressing differences between sessions

#### Average spikes per neuron by trial

We will use a data frame consisting of all trials from all sessions, with two variables per trial: average spikes per neuron, and feedback type, in order to train a model on predicting feedback type based on average spikes per neuron.

Each session measures a different set of neurons, so measuring the number of total spikes per session is not standardized between different sessions. For example, session 6 measures 1169 neurons while session 7 measures 584 neurons, so the number of total spikes will naturally be higher in session 6 than in session 7 because of the difference in number of neurons measured. For this reason, we will measure average spikes per neuron.

Below is a histogram depicting this large data set, with lines indicating the medians.

```{r}

spk.means = c()
feeds = c()
for (i in 1:18) {
  spks = all_sessions[[i]]$spks 
  feed = all_sessions[[i]]$feedback_type
  n.neurons = length(all_sessions[[i]]$brain_area)
  for (j in seq_along(spks)) {
    #spk means
    spks2 = spks[[j]] 
    spks3 = spks2[,10:30]
    spk.mean = (sum(spks3))/n.neurons
    spk.means = c(spk.means,spk.mean)
    
    #feedback type
    feed.trial = feed[[j]]
    feeds = c(feeds, feed.trial)
  }
}
all.spk.means.df = data.frame(
  avg.spks = spk.means,
  feedback = feeds
)

all.spk.means.df$feedback = factor(all.spk.means.df$feedback)

ggplot(all.spk.means.df, aes(x = avg.spks, fill= feedback)) + 
  geom_histogram(binwidth = 0.025, alpha = 0.7) + 
  facet_wrap(~feedback, scales = "free") + 
  labs(title = "Average Spikes per Neuron by Feedback Type, All Sessions", 
       x = "Feedback Type: -1 = Failure, 1 = Success", 
       y = "Frequency") +
  geom_vline(data = subset(all.spk.means.df, feedback == 1), 
             aes(xintercept = median(avg.spks)), color = "blue", linetype = "dashed") +
  geom_vline(data = subset(all.spk.means.df, feedback == -1), 
             aes(xintercept = median(avg.spks)), color = "red", linetype = "dashed")
```

```{r}

all.avg = c()
for (i in 1:18) {
  spks.trial=all_sessions[[i]]$spks[[1]]
  total.spikes=apply(spks.trial,1,sum)
  avg.spikes=mean(total.spikes)
  all.avg = c(all.avg, avg.spikes)
}

di.table1 = data.frame(
  `Mouse Name` = meta$mouse_name,
  `Session Date` = meta$date_exp,
  `Success Rate` = meta$success_rate,
  `Average Spikes per Neuron` = all.avg
)

# kable(di.table1, format = "html", table.attr = "class='table table-striped'",digits=2)

```

#### Average spikes per session-specific brain area by trial

In addition, it is impossible to standardize the brain areas between sessions because of the difference in neurons measured. Therefore, it is not possible to predict for feedback type based on specific brain area activity with data from all the sessions. However, it is possible to train one model based just on Session 1, and another based just on Session 18. With this method, the results may be less accurate because of the lack of training data available from just Session 1 and Session 18. 

Below are bar plots of the average spikes per brain area of session 1 and session 18, separated by success and failure.

```{r}
# data frame of average brain spikes per brain area of session 1

s1.avg.spks = all_summaries[[1]]

s1.avg.predict = s1.avg.spks[,-c(ncol(s1.avg.spks) - 2:0)]

## 4. Predictive modeling <a id="model"></a>

### Model A: Predicting feedback based on average spikes per neuron

We will predict feedback based on the number of average spikes per neuron. As we are predicting from only one factor (average total spikes per neuron), we will use a generalized linear model. To train the model, we will use a subset of 80% of our data, and test it on the remaining 20%.

```{r, include = FALSE}
set.seed(22324)

# all.spk.means.df

# linear model

# split data
n_obs = nrow(all.spk.means.df)
sample <- sample.int(n = n_obs, size = floor(.8 * n_obs), replace = F)
train <- all.spk.means.df[sample, ]
test  <- all.spk.means.df[-sample, ]

# logistic regression
fit1 <- glm(feedback ~ avg.spks, data = train, family="binomial")

# prediction model
pred1 <- predict(fit1, test %>% select(-feedback), type = 'response')
prediction1 <- as.numeric(ifelse(pred1 > 0.5, 1, -1))
prediction1_factor <- factor(ifelse(prediction1 >0.5, 1, -1), levels = c(1,-1))
actual_factor <- factor(test$feedback, levels = c(1,-1))
accuracy_mA = mean(prediction1_factor == actual_factor)

# confusion matrix
conf_matrix <- table(actual_factor, prediction1_factor)

true_pos = conf_matrix[1]
false_pos = conf_matrix[2]
true_neg = conf_matrix[4]
false_neg = conf_matrix[3]

all_neg = true_neg + false_neg
all_pos = true_pos + false_pos

#auc value
auc_value1 = roc(test$feedback,pred1)$auc

```

The reported accuracy of this model is `r round(accuracy_mA, 4)` for our simulated test and training data set. The confusion matrix indicates that the model assigned `r all_neg` failures with `r true_neg` of these being correct, and `r all_pos` successes with `r true_pos` of these being correct. These values indicate that the model is extremely over assigning successes, to the point where it is not assigning failures for any of the values in our test data. 

This model has the same error rate as the naive model which assigns successes to every value in the test data set indiscriminately. Therefore, the model performance is very poor.

### Model B: Predicting feedback based on average spike rate per time bin

For this model, we will predict feedback type based on many factors: the average spike rate for every time bin (40 bins in total), and the interaction effects between these factors. Since there are many factors, we will use extreme gradient boosting. To train the model, we will use a subset of 80% of our data, and test it on the remaining 20%. 

```{r, include = FALSE}
set.seed(22324) #reproducibility

label <- as.numeric(full_functional_tibble$success)
X <- model.matrix(~., bin_df)

trainIndex <- createDataPartition(label, p = .8, 
                                  list = FALSE, 
                                  times = 1)
train_df <- bin_df[trainIndex, ]
train_X <- X[trainIndex,]
test_df <- bin_df[-trainIndex, ]
test_X <- X[-trainIndex,]

train_label <- label[trainIndex]
test_label <- label[-trainIndex]

xgb_model <- xgboost(data = train_X, label = train_label, objective = "binary:logistic", nround = 10)

```

```{r}
predictions <- predict(xgb_model, newdata = test_X)
predicted_labels <- as.numeric(ifelse(predictions > 0.5, 1, 0))
accuracy_mB <- mean(predicted_labels == test_label)

conf_matrix <- confusionMatrix(as.factor(predicted_labels), as.factor(test_label))

true_neg = conf_matrix$table[1]
false_neg = conf_matrix$table[2]
true_pos = conf_matrix$table[4]
false_pos = conf_matrix$table[3]

all_neg = true_neg + false_neg
all_pos = true_pos + false_pos

```

The reported accuracy of this model is `r round(accuracy_mB, 4)` for our simulated test and training data set. The confusion matrix indicates that the model assigned `r all_neg` failures with `r true_neg` of these being correct, and `r all_pos` successes with `r true_pos` of these being correct. This indicates that the model is over assigning failures to our test data set.

Below is the precision-recall curve for this model, which is useful in evaluating data sets that are imbalanced. Our data set is imbalanced as there are more successes than failures consistently. The curve represents the performance of the model across different threshold values, and its location in the mid to upper right of the plot indicates moderately good model performance.

```{r}

pr_curve_data <- pr.curve(scores.class0 = predicted_labels, weights.class0 = test_label, curve = TRUE)

plot(pr_curve_data, main = "Precision-Recall Curve, Model B")
```

### Model C: Predicting feedback based on difference in L/R contrast

We will predict feedback based on difference in L/R contrast. According to Steinmetz et al. (2019), the mice were most successful when there was a single, high contrast stimuli, and least successful when there were single, low contrast stimuli or two stimuli with similar contrasts. We will apply a generalized linear model to simplify the model as we are predicting based on only one factor. To train the model, we will use a subset of 80% of our data, and test it on the remaining 20%.

```{r, include = FALSE}

set.seed(22324)

# all.lr.diffs.df

all.lr.diffs.df$feedback[all.lr.diffs.df$feedback == "Success"] = 1
all.lr.diffs.df$feedback[all.lr.diffs.df$feedback == "Failure"] = -1
all.lr.diffs.df$feedback = as.factor(all.lr.diffs.df$feedback)

# anova? linear model prob

# split data
n_obs = nrow(all.lr.diffs.df)
sample <- sample.int(n = n_obs, size = floor(.8 * n_obs), replace = F)
train <- all.lr.diffs.df[sample, ]
test  <- all.lr.diffs.df[-sample, ]

# logistic regression
fit2 <- glm(feedback ~ lr.diffs, data = train, family="binomial")

# prediction model
pred2 <- predict(fit2, test %>% select(-feedback), type = 'response')
prediction2 <- as.numeric(ifelse(pred2 > 0.5, 1, -1))
prediction2_factor <- factor(ifelse(prediction2 >0.5, 1, -1), levels = c(1,-1))
actual_factor <- factor(test$feedback, levels = c(1,-1))
accuracy_mC = mean(prediction2_factor == actual_factor)

# confusion matrix
conf_matrix <- table(actual_factor, prediction2_factor)

true_pos = conf_matrix[1]
false_pos = conf_matrix[2]
true_neg = conf_matrix[4]
false_neg = conf_matrix[3]

all_neg = true_neg + false_neg
all_pos = true_pos + false_pos

#auc value
auc_value2 = roc(test$feedback,pred2)$auc


```

The reported accuracy of this model is `r round(accuracy_mC, 4)` for our simulated test and training data set. The confusion matrix indicates that the model assigned `r all_neg` failures with `r true_neg` of these being correct, and `r all_pos` successes with `r true_pos` of these being correct. These values indicate that the model is extremely over assigning successes, to the point where it is not assigning failures for any of the values in our test data. 

As with model A, this model has the same error rate as the naive model which assigns successes to every value in the test data set indiscriminately. Therefore, the model performance is poor.

### Model D: Predicting feedback based on average spikes per session-specific brain area

We will predict feedback based on the average spikes per brain area. Since the brain areas measured in each session vary, these models are session-specific. In addition, since these models are specialized to each session, there may be possible problems with overfitting, as the training data set size is small. As we are predicting based on a large number of factors and the interactions between them, we will use extreme gradient boosting. To train the model, we will use a subset of 80% of our data, and test it on the remaining 20%.

#### Session 1

```{r, include = FALSE}

                                  list = FALSE, 
                                  times = 1)
train_df <- s1.pred[trainIndex, ]
train_X <- X[trainIndex,]
test_df <- s1.pred[-trainIndex, ]
test_X <- X[-trainIndex,]

train_label <- label[trainIndex]

true_pos = conf_matrix$table[4]
false_pos = conf_matrix$table[3]

all_neg = true_neg + false_neg
all_pos = true_pos + false_pos

```

The brain areas measured in session 1 were ACA, CA3, DG, LS, MOs, root, SUB, and VISp.

The reported accuracy of this model is `r round(accuracy_mD1, 4)` for our simulated test and training data set. The confusion matrix indicates that the model assigned `r all_neg` failures with `r true_neg` of these being correct, and `r all_pos` successes with `r true_pos` of these being correct. These values indicate that the model is slightly over assigning successes.

Below is a precision-recall curve for this model. The high AUC indicates better model performance. At higher recall values, precision decreases, starting at recall around 0.75.

```{r}
pr_curve_data <- pr.curve(scores.class0 = predicted_labels, weights.class0 = test_label, curve = TRUE)

plot(pr_curve_data, main = "Precision-Recall Curve, Model D, Session 1")
```

#### Session 18

The brain areas measured in Session 18 were ACB, CA3, CP, LGd, OT, root, SI, SNr, TH, and ZI.

test_label <- label[-trainIndex]

xgb_model2 <- xgboost(data = train_X, label = train_label, objective = "binary:logistic", nround = 10)

```

```{r}
predictions <- predict(xgb_model2, newdata = test_X)
predicted_labels <- as.numeric(ifelse(predictions > 0.5, 1, 0))

true_pos = conf_matrix$table[4]
false_pos = conf_matrix$table[3]

all_neg = true_neg + false_neg
all_pos = true_pos + false_pos

```

The reported accuracy of this model is `r round(accuracy_mD2, 4)` for our simulated test and training data set. The confusion matrix indicates that the model assigned `r all_neg` failures with `r true_neg` of these being correct, and `r all_pos` successes with `r true_pos` of these being correct. The accuracy of this model is high, indicating good model performance. 

Below is a precision-recall curve for this model. The high AUC indicates better model performance.

```{r}
pr_curve_data <- pr.curve(scores.class0 = predicted_labels, weights.class0 = test_label, curve = TRUE)

plot(pr_curve_data, main = "Precision-Recall Curve, Model D, Session 18")
```

### Model comparisons

```{r}
AUC = c(0.6030, 0.7205, 0.5947, 0.8385, 0.8047)
labels = c("A", "B", "C", "D, session 1", "D, session 18")

df = data.frame(
  Model = labels,
  `AUC` = AUC
)

kable(df, format = "html", table.attr ="class='table table striped'")
```

The area under the curve (AUC) value indicates the area under the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve. The AUC value summarizes the performance of the prediction model across all threshold values. An AUC close to 1 indicates excellent performance, while closer to 0 indicates very poor performance. 

Based on the AUC values of each model, indicated in the model above, the best models were both Model D models, with AUC values of 0.8385 and 0.8047 respectively. For this reason, we will choose Model D as our final model to test on the test data sets. However, it must be kept in mind that because of the small training data size, Model D may suffer from highly variable performance due to overfitting.

## 5. Prediction performance on the test sets <a id="performance"></a>

We will now test our models using the given test data sets. In order to maximize the training data set size, we will retrain each of the two models on all the data from session 1 and 18 respectively (instead of 80%.)

In addition, the accuracy of the model for the test data was worse than our simulated data in Section 4 (0.7273.) This indicates that as expected, the model was overfitted, which may have led to the decrease in performance for the test data.

In comparison, the naive model, which assigns successes indiscriminately, had a reported accuracy of `r accuracy_bias.` The accuracy of this model was equal to the naive model's accuracy, which indicates that neither model is a better predictor. In addition, like the Session 1 model, the accuracy of the model for the test data was worse than our simulated data in Section 4 (0.7907.)

## 6. Discussion <a id="disc"></a>

Overall, the best models we tested predicted feedback based on number of average spikes in specific brain areas. These models were session-specific, and had relatively similar performance with the test data sets.

<img src="C:/Users/nicol/Pictures/Screenshots/brainareasmice.png" alt="brain areas">

*Source: Steinmetz et al. (2019)*

Of the brain areas measured in Session 1, the highest correlations observed were positive, indicating that an increase in average number of spikes of all neurons in those brain areas generally increased success rate of trials. Likewise, the highest correlations observed in brain areas for Session 18 were all positive. (See appendix (<a href="a-1-1">Section I.i</a>) for the correlation matrices.) There are multiple possible reasons for why these specific brain areas are most highly correlated. We can hypothesize that the main functions of each of these brain areas relate to the task the mice were given.

In Session 1, the three brain areas most positively correlated with success rate were MOs, LS, and ACA. MOs and ACA refer to parts in the secondary part of the motor cortex, which primarily deal with premeditated movement (i.e. movement that requires thought, not reflexive movement such as your heart beating) (Jeong et al., 2016). It is possible that this relates to conversion of information from the visual stimulus to the movement of the mouse's forepaws on the wheel. LS refers to the lateral septum, which is a region relating to reward and memory. In particular, it regulates hormones like dopamine which make the mouse react positively in response to rewards (Blume et al., 1982), which could be related to the water-reward system that was used to train the mice. Studies have shown that mice, even before the reward is given, when trained with a reward system, are capable of associating certain actions with rewards, a clear example of operant conditioning (Freund et al., 1972.)

In Session 18, the three brain areas most positively correlated with success rate were SNr, LGd, and root. SNr refers to the substantia nigra, which deals primarily with the regulation of dopamine (Aumann et al., 2013). As with the lateral septum (LS) in Session 1, this may be related to the water-reward system. LGd refers to the dorsal lateral geniculate nucleus, which is a specialized part of the thalamus that deals with visual perception (Bienkowski et al., 2019.) Essentially, it relays visual information to the rest of the brain, which is a function essential to the mouse's task. Lastly, root may refer to a cranial nerve root. There are a large number of these cranial nerve roots, each with different functions, so it is unclear how this specifically relates to the study.

In Brinkman (1984), lesions were made to certain regions of the motor cortex of monkeys in order to study the direct effect of the loss of function in that area would have on the monkey's ability to carry out normal motor functions. If possible and ethical, a study similar to this would be highly beneficial in deepening our understanding of the correlation between specific brain areas and performance.

#### I.i. Which brain areas are most relevant to success rate? <a id="a-1-1"></a>

Below are the correlation matrices for each trial, where red in the feedback column indicates that when more spikes were present for that brain area, the success rate was higher, and blue indicates that when more spikes were present for that brain area, the success rate was lower.

```{r}

corr1[[1]]
corr1[[2]]
corr1[[3]]
corr1[[4]]
corr1[[5]]
corr1[[6]]

```

As seen in the above correlation matrices, there seems to be an overall weak positive correlation between success rate and spikes in most brain areas. Notably, neurons in the visual cortex, thalamus, hippocampus, and basal ganglia had a consistently higher correlation to success rate than other neurons, with average correlations over all sessions of 0.162, 0.171, 0.156, and 0.157 respectively. 

The visual cortex (average correlation = 0.162) primarily deals with the processing of visual information. In successful trials, visual cortex neurons were the first to be activated, along with the superior colliculus (which is related to motor functions) (Steinmetz et al.) Based on its positive correlation with success rate, heightened visual processing is correlated with a successful trial; i.e. when a mouse visually processes the stimulus more, it is more successful.

The thalamus (average correlation = 0.171) processes all sensory information except smell and passes it to the cerebral cortex for interpretation. Based on its positive correlation with success rate, successful relaying of sensory information to the cerebral cortex is correlated with a successful trial.

The hippocampus (average correlation = 0.156) primarily deals with memory and learning, in particular the processing of short-term memory into long-term memory. This suggests that long-term learning may play a part in the success of trials.

The basal ganglia (average correlation = 0.157) is responsible for motor control. This may be related to how the mouse responds to the stimulus and makes decision, through a wheel controlled by their forepaws; i.e. the mouse must successfully control its movements in order to have a successful trial.

#### I.ii. Does more brain activity correlate to success rate? <a id="a-1-2"></a>

```{r}

grid.arrange(grobs=s1.s18.avg.spks.plots1, ncol=1)
grid.arrange(grobs=s1.s18.avg.spks.plots2, ncol=1)
grid.arrange(grobs=s1.s18.avg.spks.plots3, ncol=1)
grid.arrange(grobs=s1.s18.avg.spks.plots4, ncol=1)

```

The greatest percent change in success was in the time interval of 0.1 to 0.3s.

<a href="#eda">Back to Exploratory Data Analysis</a>

#### I.iii. How do the values of left/right contrast correlate to success rate? <a id="a-1-3"></a>

Below are correlation matrices relating the amount of left/right contrast to feedback type. A blue value indicates that as contrast increases, success rate decreases. Likewise, a red value indicates that as contrast increases, success rate increases.

```{r}
grid.arrange(grobs=list(corr4[[1]],corr4[[2]]), ncol = 2)
grid.arrange(grobs=list(corr4[[3]],corr4[[4]]), ncol = 2)
grid.arrange(grobs=list(corr4[[5]],corr4[[6]]), ncol = 2)
grid.arrange(grobs=list(corr4[[7]],corr4[[8]]), ncol = 2)
grid.arrange(grobs=list(corr4[[9]],corr4[[10]]), ncol = 2)
grid.arrange(grobs=list(corr4[[11]],corr4[[12]]), ncol = 2)
grid.arrange(grobs=list(corr4[[13]],corr4[[14]]), ncol = 2)
grid.arrange(grobs=list(corr4[[15]],corr4[[16]]), ncol = 2)
grid.arrange(grobs=list(corr4[[17]],corr4[[18]]), ncol = 2)

```

As seen in the above matrices, there is little to no overall correlation between amount of left/right contrast and success rate across sessions. In individual sessions, there seem to be some weak correlations between contrast and success rate, but no overall trend.

There seems to be an overall weak correlation between difference in left and right contrast and feedback type.
